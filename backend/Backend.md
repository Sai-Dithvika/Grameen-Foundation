## Backend Overview

The backend of this project is built using a combination of robust and efficient technologies and libraries, ensuring a secure, scalable, and efficient data management system. The key technologies and tools used include:

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express.js is used to create RESTful APIs, allowing for easy communication between the frontend and backend of the application.

- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for server-side scripting. JavaScript, along with Node.js, enables the development of dynamic and interactive web applications.

- **Python**: While not directly used in the backend as described, Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for various backend tasks, including data analysis, machine learning, and more.

- **API**: The application exposes RESTful API endpoints, allowing the frontend to interact with the backend seamlessly. These APIs are built using Express.js and are designed to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Postman**: A popular API development and testing tool used for testing the API endpoints. Postman allows developers to send requests to the API and view the responses, ensuring that the API behaves as expected.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is used for data storage, providing a scalable and flexible solution for managing application data.

- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation is used to structure the data exchanged between the client and the server. JSON provides a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

- **bcrypt**: A library for hashing and salting passwords. bcrypt is used to securely store user passwords in the database, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain secure.

This combination of technologies and tools allows us to build a secure, scalable, and efficient backend for our application, providing a solid foundation for the data management and API functionalities.
